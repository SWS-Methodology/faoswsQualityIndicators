["preface.html", "Preface How to use this book Why to use the SWS Migration actors", " Preface How to use this book The book focuses not only on the implementation of the Quality Indicators (QI) plugin in the Statistical Working System (SWS) for each disseminated domain, but it also discusses the data structure, workflow, data aggregates and the indicators themselves. Moreover, the book covers the Shiny app that has been developed to visualize the quality indicators and underlying data, draw on-the-fly charts and generate automatic pdf reports based on the selection parameters (dataset, area, element, item and year) chosen by the user. The quality indicators hereby implemented have as reference the following documents: the Statistical Standard Series - Quality Indicators to Be Disseminated to External Users document produced by the Office of the Chief Statistician (OCS) and endorsed by the Interdepartmental Working Group (IDWG) on Statistics and the Quality Indicators - FAO ESS review for questionnaire-based FAOSTAT domains, which contains the ready-to-use quality indicators, based on the previous document. The chapters are organized as follows: Chapter Description Ch 1 Provides the framework and entire overview. Ch 2 Provides the whole documentation of the module faoswsQualityIndicators. Ch 3 Provides the whole documentation of the Shiny App of the Quality Indicators. Appendix Describes all code lists, reference tables (datatables) and data sets. Why to use the SWS The Statistical Working System (SWS) is a corporate system that supports data collection, processing and validation, metadata management, and quality assessment of FAO’s main statistical domains in line with the Generic Statistical Business Process Model. It has a dual nature – both technological and statistical – and for this reason, is developed by two different teams (the IT Division [CSI] and the Statistics Division [ESS]). The SWS provides an end-to-end solution for inputting and storing raw data, performing automated statistical processes (e.g. imputation, validation, etc.), and producing data that are ready for dissemination. Moreover, the reasons why you should use the SWS are: The SWS improves data quality by centralizing and standardizing the maintenance of data, classification systems, methodologies, and standards. The SWS is cost-efficient in terms of statistical development and functionalities: Technical units can adopt methods and even pieces of codes developed for other units: documentation and scripts are open; Users have direct access to some common datasets, thus removing duplication of efforts; New functionalities reflect the requirements of all users and are available to all users, with economies of scale on IT development. Users have full control of the quality of the data they are producing: Increased use of advanced and semi-automated statistical methods reduce the need for manual interventions and ensure that results are reproducible; Establishment and use of a ‘basic’ set of quality and performance indicators for processes and outputs based on the FAO Statistical Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF); Assessment and publication of quality indicators on a regular basis. The SWS ensures corporate data consistency through the adoption of statistical standards. In particular, the SWS Facilitates the adoption of corporate standard classifications, metadata and code lists through seamless integration with the corporate Reference Data Management system; Reduces the fragmentation and duplication of sources (e.g. population data), thus reducing inconsistencies across technical units; Provides flexible tools for a wide range of data collection processes including web data scraping and questionnaire management, thus reducing the duplication of data collection efforts. The SWS preserves institutional knowledge by recording the history of data revisions, automating methodology and calculations, and providing end users with unambiguous instructions to follow.

Migration actors Any migration into the SWS requires the interaction between at least three actors: The technical units responsible for the data dissemination of the several statistical processes related to Agriculture Production and Trade, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Land, Forestry Production and Trade, Producer Prices, Fisheries and AQUASTAT. The ESS - Methodological Innovation Team (ESS - SWS) responsible for the implementation and documentation of the required statistical processes. From the ESS - SWS team the focal points are: Bruno Caetano Vidigal Statistician (ESS) Carola Fabi Senior Statistician (ESS) The CSI - SWS the primary backend and frontend maintainer of the SWS and responsible for the implementation and documentation of non-statistical processes (IT infrastructure). The CSI - SWS team have as interlocutors: Matteo Terrinoni Lead Front End Developer (CSI) Enrico Anello Full Stack Developer (CSI) Rohi Fadlun Full Stack Java Developer (CSI) John Rowell Information Technology Officer (CSI) "],
["QualityIndicatorsFramework.html", "Chapter 1 Quality Indicators Framework 1.1 Build up historical data disseminated in the SWS 1.2 Data Processing 1.3 Aggregates 1.4 Results", " Chapter 1 Quality Indicators Framework The Quality Indicators (QI) module is meant to take place right after a statsitical process has been validated. This means that a technical unit has already finalized its entire data processing (questionnaire dispatch \\(\\Rightarrow\\) data collection \\(\\Rightarrow\\) data entry \\(\\Rightarrow\\) data cleaning \\(\\Rightarrow\\) imputation \\(\\Rightarrow\\) validation) and it is ready to release the data. Thus, the officer in charge can analyse the quality of the data before disseminating and may return to any step of the process if he/she deems necessary. The workflow of the QI module is shown below. As mentioned above, it starts when the data is ready to be released. In the SWS context, this means that the technical unit can tag its data set and materialize it in the SWS domain Disseminated Datasets. Therefore, the faoswsQualityIndicators module can compile the indicators and save them in a dedicated dataset in the domain Quality Indicators. In this way, the officer in charge can find the results either in the SWS or in the Shiny App. It is important to highlight that each technical unit is responsible for its own data in the domain Disseminated Datasets, which means that the technical unit is the only one who is able to populate/modify its own data. Figure 1.1: Workflow of the Quality Indicators module in the SWS 1.1 Build up historical data disseminated in the SWS It is known that the SWS was built to be a working system and not a dissemination platform. This means that unless a technical unit creates a dedicated dataset to store only the dissemination data, this data will be found only in the dissemination platform. Thus, there might be differences between the data found in the two systems. Despite this issue, it is still worth to compute the QI for the historical data. In order to do so, there is a need to retrieve the data from the dissemination platforms (e.g. FAOSTAT) and bring it back to the SWS. 1.2 Data Processing 1.3 Aggregates 1.4 Results "],

["sws-resources.html", "A SWS resources A.1 Code lists", " A SWS resources SWS resources are R modules, data tables, data sets, and code lists comprising a migration framework. Data tables are typically used as auxiliary data to help R modules to achieve their goals. The statistical domains in SWS, through code/reference lists, define the dimensions of the datasets. Therefore, datasets are primarily used to store code list - referenced values as either input and output in the SWS. A.1 Code lists Code lists, also called reference lists in SWS parlance, are the dimensions making up the data sets that are designed by the user to store analytical results from SWS modules. The dimensions are statistical-domain-specific and are defined by the technical unit to reflect its needs regarding data collection, processing, and dissemination while meeting FAO standards. Each data set dimension has a set of codes and their associated descriptions. Thus, code lists serve to the purpose of standardization, visualization, and metadata by associating standardized codes to standardized names in the SWS data set outputs. A typical SWS compliant data set has, therefore, the following dimensions/reference lists: Geographic area. Representing a spatial scale the information is measured at. For example, countries, territories, regional aggregates, regional special groups aggregates, global aggregates. Items. Those one wants to take a measurement from. For example, commodities, commodity groups, land use types, species, etc. Typical item dimension names are measuredItemCPC, *measuredItemHS, measuredItem. "]
