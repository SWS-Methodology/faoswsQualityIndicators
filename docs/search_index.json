["preface.html", "Preface How to use this book Why to use the SWS Migration actors", " Preface How to use this book The book focuses not only on the implementation of the Quality Indicators (QI) plugin in the Statistical Working System (SWS) for each disseminated domain, but it also discusses the data structure, workflow, data aggregates and the indicators themselves. Moreover, the book covers the Shiny app that has been developed to visualize the quality indicators and underlying data, draw on-the-fly charts and generate automatic pdf reports based on the selection parameters (dataset, area, element, item and year) chosen by the user. The quality indicators hereby implemented have as reference the following documents: the Statistical Standard Series - Quality Indicators for External Users document produced by the Office of the Chief Statistician (OCS) and endorsed by the Interdepartmental Working Group (IDWG) on Statistics and the Quality Indicators - FAO ESS review for questionnaire-based FAOSTAT domains, which contains the ready-to-use quality indicators, based on the previous document. The chapters are organized as follows: Chapter Description Ch 1 Provides the framework and entire overview. Ch 2 Describes the quality indicators to be calculated in the SWS. Ch 3 Provides the whole documentation of the module faoswsQualityIndicators. Ch 4 Provides the whole documentation of the Shiny App of the Quality Indicators. Appendix Describes all code lists, reference tables (datatables) and data sets. Why to use the SWS The Statistical Working System (SWS) is a corporate system that supports data collection, processing and validation, metadata management, and quality assessment of FAO’s main statistical domains in line with the Generic Statistical Business Process Model. It has a dual nature – both technological and statistical – and for this reason, is developed by two different teams (the IT Division [CSI] and the Statistics Division [ESS]). The SWS provides an end-to-end solution for inputting and storing raw data, performing automated statistical processes (e.g. imputation, validation, etc.), and producing data that are ready for dissemination. Moreover, the reasons why you should use the SWS are: The SWS improves data quality by centralizing and standardizing the maintenance of data, classification systems, methodologies, and standards. The SWS is cost-efficient in terms of statistical development and functionalities: Technical units can adopt methods and even pieces of codes developed for other units: documentation and scripts are open; Users have direct access to some common datasets, thus removing duplication of efforts; New functionalities reflect the requirements of all users and are available to all users, with economies of scale on IT development. Users have full control of the quality of the data they are producing: Increased use of advanced and semi-automated statistical methods reduce the need for manual interventions and ensure that results are reproducible; Establishment and use of a ‘basic’ set of quality and performance indicators for processes and outputs based on the FAO Statistical Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF); Assessment and publication of quality indicators on a regular basis. The SWS ensures corporate data consistency through the adoption of statistical standards. In particular, the SWS Facilitates the adoption of corporate standard classifications, metadata and code lists through seamless integration with the corporate Reference Data Management system; Reduces the fragmentation and duplication of sources (e.g. population data), thus reducing inconsistencies across technical units; Provides flexible tools for a wide range of data collection processes including web data scraping and questionnaire management, thus reducing the duplication of data collection efforts. The SWS preserves institutional knowledge by recording the history of data revisions, automating methodology and calculations, and providing end users with unambiguous instructions to follow. Go to the Statistical Working System website (restricted access). Migration actors Any migration into the SWS requires the interaction between at least three actors: The technical units responsible for the data dissemination of the several statistical processes related to Agriculture Production and Trade, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Land, Forestry Production and Trade, Producer Prices, Fisheries and AQUASTAT. The ESS - Methodological Innovation Team (ESS - SWS) responsible for the implementation and documentation of the required statistical processes. From the ESS - SWS team the focal points are: Bruno Caetano Vidigal Statistician (ESS) Carola Fabi Senior Statistician (ESS) The CSI - SWS the primary backend and frontend maintainer of the SWS and responsible for the implementation and documentation of non-statistical processes (IT infrastructure). The CSI - SWS team have as interlocutors: Matteo Terrinoni Lead Front End Developer (CSI) Enrico Anello Full Stack Developer (CSI) Rohi Fadlun Full Stack Java Developer (CSI) John Rowell Information Technology Officer (CSI) "],
["QualityIndicatorsFramework.html", "Chapter 1 Quality Indicators Framework 1.1 Build up historical data disseminated in the SWS 1.2 Statistical Outputs", " Chapter 1 Quality Indicators Framework The Quality Indicators (QI) module is meant to take place right after a statistical process has been validated. This means that a technical unit has already finalized its entire data processing (questionnaire dispatch \\(\\Rightarrow\\) data collection \\(\\Rightarrow\\) data entry \\(\\Rightarrow\\) data cleaning \\(\\Rightarrow\\) imputation \\(\\Rightarrow\\) validation) and it is ready to release the data. Thus, the officer in charge can analyse the quality of the data before disseminating and may return to any step of the process if he/she deems necessary. The workflow of the QI module is shown below. As mentioned above, it starts when the data is ready to be released. In the SWS context, this means that the technical unit can tag its data set and materialize it in the SWS domain Disseminated Datasets. Therefore, the faoswsQualityIndicators module can compile the indicators and save them in a dedicated dataset in the domain Quality Indicators. In this way, the officer in charge can find the results either in the SWS or in the Shiny App. It is important to highlight that each technical unit is responsible for its own data in the domain Disseminated Datasets, which means that the technical unit is the only one who is able to populate/modify its own data. Figure 1.1: Overall Workflow of the Quality Indicators module in the SWS 1.1 Build up historical data disseminated in the SWS It is known that the SWS was built to be a working system and not a dissemination platform. This means that unless a technical unit creates a dedicated data set to store only the dissemination data, this data will be found only in the dissemination platform because as time passes, the data may be revised or another imputation method tested and not necessarily be disseminated for various reasons. Thus, there might be differences between the data found in the two systems. Despite this issue, it is still worth to compute the QI for the historical data disseminated. In order to do so, the CSI-SWS team had to retrieve the data from the dissemination platforms (e.g. FAOSTAT) and bring it back to the SWS for the technical units that did not create the data dissemination. This exercise is illustrated in the below figure. Figure 1.2: Workflow to retrieve historical data disseminated For each disseminated data to be migrated to SWS there is a need to convert: areas to geographicAreaM49; items to measuredItemCPC (or another code list that contains those items); elements to measuredElement (or another code list that contains those elements); flags to SWS flag system (flagObservationStatus and flagMethod). Converting areas, items and elements from one system to another one is usually straightforward. However, the flag conversion is possible only from SWS to FAOSTAT. The other way round is not feasible as there is no one-to-one correspondence. Therefore the only way to retrieve the flags is, given a combination country-element-item-year-value disseminated, convert areas, items and elements to the SWS format and searches for it in the SWS - including in the historical data. The two data points should match exactly in terms of values for that year. Thus one can find the SWS flag system. If the values in both systems do not match, the algorithm takes the most recent figure with its flags. 1.2 Statistical Outputs FAO is responsible for the dissemination of several statistical outputs including data on agriculture production and trade, forestry, fisheries, fertilizers, pesticides, producer prices and others. Along with the data, it is also important for transparency purposes to release information regarding its quality. Thus this book describes in details the process to compile the QI for each of these outputs, as they are composed of differents kinds of elements, items and areas. Moreover, each statistical process may have its own data processing, from harvesting to storage, with peculiarities that need to be taken into consideration when calculating the QI. 1.2.1 Crops Crops are disseminated in FAOSTAT under Production. In order to calculate their QI, there was a need to build up the historical data disseminated as described in Build up historical data disseminated in the SWS. Its correspondent data set in the SWS is in the domain agriculture, data set aproduction. 1.2.2 Livestock Primary Livestock Primary is disseminated in FAOSTAT under Production. In order to calculate their QI, there was a need to build up the historical data disseminated as described in Build up historical data disseminated in the SWS. Its correspondent data set in the SWS is in the domain agriculture, data set aproduction. 1.2.3 Crops and livestock products Crops and livestock products are disseminated in FAOSTAT under Trade. In order to calculate their QI, there was a need to build up the historical data disseminated as described in Build up historical data disseminated in the SWS. Its correspondent data set in the SWS is in the domain trade, data set total_trade_cpc_m49. 1.2.4 Live animals Live animals are disseminated in FAOSTAT under Trade. In order to calculate their QI, there was a need to build up the historical data disseminated as described in Build up historical data disseminated in the SWS. Its correspondent data set in the SWS is in the domain trade, data set total_trade_cpc_m49. 1.2.5 Fertilizers by Nutrient Fertilizers by Nutrient are disseminated in FAOSTAT under Inputs. The Eco Team responsible for this output has already created a dedicated dissemination data set called Fertilizers (dissemination) in the SWS to storage the data. Therefore, there was a need to make a copy of it into the domain Disseminated Datasets. 1.2.6 Fertilizers by Product Fertilizers by Product are disseminated in FAOSTAT under Inputs. The Eco Team responsible for this output has already created a dedicated dissemination data set called Fertilizers (dissemination) in the SWS to storage the data. Therefore, there was a need to make a copy of it into the domain Disseminated Datasets. 1.2.7 Forestry Production and Trade Forestry Production and Trade are disseminated in FAOSTAT under Forestry. In order to calculate their QI, there was a need to build up the historical data disseminated as described in Build up historical data disseminated in the SWS. Its correspondent data set in the SWS is in the domain Forestry, data set forestry_prod_trade_agg_diss. 1.2.8 Fisheries 1.2.9 Producer Prices 1.2.10 Pesticides Use Pesticides Use are disseminated in FAOSTAT under Inputs. The Eco Team responsible for this output has already created a dedicated dissemination data set called Pesticides Use (dissemination) in the SWS to storage the data. Therefore, there was a need to make a copy of it into the domain Disseminated Datasets. 1.2.11 Pesticides Trade Pesticides Trade are disseminated in FAOSTAT under Inputs. The Eco Team responsible for this output has already created a dedicated dissemination data set called Pesticides Trade (dissemination) in the SWS to storage the data. Therefore, there was a need to make a copy of it into the domain Disseminated Datasets. "],
["qualityIndicators.html", "Chapter 2 Quality Indicators 2.1 Accuracy 2.2 Reliability", " Chapter 2 Quality Indicators This chapter describes the QI to be calculated in the SWS. These indicators have been proposed by OCS and endorsed by the IDWG. Nevertheless, for a better description and information regarding the indicators below, please read the following documents. the Statistical Standard Series - Quality Indicators for External Users the Quality Indicators - FAO ESS review for questionnaire-based FAOSTAT domains, which contains the ready-to-use quality indicators, based on the first document. The indicators can be split in the following dimensions: Relevance Accuracy Reliability Timeliness Punctuality Coherence Comparability Accessibility We will focus on the description and implementation of two dimensions: Accuracy and Reliability. Although all quality dimensions are very important and should be taken into account in order to measure the quality of a statistical output, accuracy and reliability are the only ones that can be measured with the disseminated data. The remain ones are feasible to measure once the technical units provide us with information regarding their calendars/deadlines. 2.1 Accuracy According to the Statistical Standard Series, accuracy is “the closeness of an estimate to the true value of what is measured. In this case, we are not interested in the accuracy of the incoming country data, but rather in assessing solely FAO’s contribution to the overall accuracy of the final statistical outputs calculated and disseminated by FAO (usually regional or global aggregates).” Below you find the indicators implemented in the SWS. 2.1.1 Questionnaire reporting rate \\[\\begin{equation} QRR = \\frac{Q_R}{Q} \\times 100 \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(Q_R\\) is the number of returned questionnaires completely or partially filled with valid information (a questionnaire partially filled whose information is not used for calculation of the final statistical outputs because not relevant or because being of poor quality should be counted as a non-response) and \\(Q\\) is the number of dispatched questionnaires. 2.1.2 Percentage of missing data points \\[\\begin{equation} PM = \\frac{n_{Missing}}{n_{Relevant}} \\times 100 \\end{equation}\\] \\(100-PM\\) returns the percentage of available data points. 2.1.3 Percentage of official data points \\[\\begin{equation} RO = \\frac{n_{Official}}{n_{Available}} \\times 100 \\end{equation}\\] 2.1.4 Percentage of imputed data points \\[\\begin{equation} RI = \\frac{n_{Imputed}}{n_{Available}} \\times 100 \\end{equation}\\] 2.1.5 Percentage of mirror data points \\[\\begin{equation} RM = \\frac{n_{Mirror}}{n_{Available}} \\times 100 \\end{equation}\\] 2.1.6 Contribution of imputed values to the final aggregate \\[\\begin{equation} CIVT = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_I} y_{Ij} + \\sum_{j=1}^{n_F} y_{Fj}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{available}} y_{.j}} \\times 100 \\end{equation}\\] In practice, the denominator, \\(\\hat t_y = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{available}} y_{.j}\\) is the estimated total of the variable Y (at the “World” or regional level) that is disseminated externally and the numerator is the sum of the values that are obtained through imputation (flags “I” and “F”). 2.1.7 Contribution of official values to the final aggregate \\[\\begin{equation} COVT = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{official}} y_{official}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{available}} y_{.j}} \\times 100 \\end{equation}\\] 2.1.8 Contribution of questionnaire values to the final aggregate \\[\\begin{equation} CQVT = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{quest}} y_{quest}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{available}} y_{.j}} \\times 100 \\end{equation}\\] 2.1.9 Contribution of mirror values to the final aggregate \\[\\begin{equation} CMVT = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{mirror}} y_{mirror}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{available}} y_{.j}} \\times 100 \\end{equation}\\] 2.2 Reliability As stated by the Statistical Standard Series, reliability “indicates how close the initial estimates are to the subsequent or final estimates.”. The revision indicators are presented hereinafter. "],

Figure 3.1: Workflow of the faoswsQualityIndicators module in the SWS for Crops Production As shown in the above workflow, the input for the QI is the output of a data cycle process (data that goes to dissemination). Thus, after getting the aggregates at area and item level, the QI functions can be applied. Although the process is simple and requires no human intervention, it is important to note that the technical units have to be very careful with the data stored in the domain Disseminated Datasets as they will drive the QI. 3.1 Quality Indicators - R functions There are two functions designed to compute the QI, where each of them is responsible for a quality dimension. This implementation aims to produce indicators for Accuracy and Reliability. 3.1.1 getAccuracy Below you find the workflow of the R function getAccuracy.

Within this spirit the Quality Indicators App was developed aiming to ease the analysis of the QI for the statsitical processes produced and disseminated by FAO. Moreover, it was intended to be an easy-to-use tool for producing and presenting reports at international conferences. The app consumes data from the Production Environment of the SWS, domain Quality Indicators and contains the following tabs: Create Report - within this tab you can draw on-the-fly charts and generate automatic pdf reports based on the selection parameters (dataset, area, element, item and year); Stats - you can analyse the data distribution of a particular dataset-element-item-quality indicator-year.

Data tables are typically used as auxiliary data to help R modules to achieve their goals. The statistical domains in SWS, through code/reference lists, define the dimensions of the datasets. Therefore, datasets are primarily used to store code list - referenced values as either input and output in the SWS. A.1 Code lists Code lists, also called reference lists in SWS parlance, are the dimensions making up the data sets that are designed by the user to store analytical results from SWS modules. The dimensions are statistical-domain-specific and are defined by the technical unit to reflect its needs regarding data collection, processing, and dissemination while meeting FAO standards. Each data set dimension has a set of codes and their associated descriptions. Thus, code lists serve to the purpose of standardization, visualization, and metadata by associating standardized codes to standardized names in the SWS data set outputs. A typical SWS compliant data set has, therefore, the following dimensions/reference lists: Geographic area. Representing a spatial scale the information is measured at. For example, countries, territories, regional aggregates, regional special groups aggregates, global aggregates. Items. Those one wants to take a measurement from. For example, commodities, commodity groups, land use types, species, etc. Typical item dimension names are measuredItemCPC, *measuredItemHS, measuredItem. Elements. Often representing a measurement that can be taken across different items. For example, area, production, share. Typical element dimension names are measuredElement, *measuredElementTrade, aquastatElement. Time (the time unit the data is displayed for: year, months, etc). timePointYears represents year.

Information in datatables can be of a number of types. For example, conversion factors, arithmetic formulas, mapping between flags, mapping between international classifications, etc. In SWS hierarchy, all datatables reside in a given statistical domain. Variable names (aka column names) in SWS Datatables are more flexible in terms of the names they can take than SWS datasets. One can find SWS Datatables naming variables as element_code, element_code_sws, element_code_faostat, etc. Likewise, columns describing countries across different datatables may have different classification systems. This flexibility in Datatables is beneficial as it allows to accommodate different auxiliary information. In the Quality Indicators framework, the datatables are in the domain Quality Indicators.
