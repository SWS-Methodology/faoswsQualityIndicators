<blank>,Official figure,Observation reported to FAO by official statistical government agencies.
B,Time series break,Break observations are characterized as such whendifferent content exist or a different methodology has beenapplied to this observation as compared with the preceding one (the one given for the previous period).
E,Estimated value,"Observation obtained through an estimation methodology (e.g. to produce back-casts) or based on the use of a limited amount of data or ad hoc sampling and through additional calculations (e.g. to produce a value at an early stage of the production stage while not all data are available). It may also be used in case of experimental data (e.g. in the context of a pilot ahead of a full scale production process) or in case of data of (anticipated/assessed) low quality. If needed, additional (uncoded) information can be provided through (free text) “comments” at the observation level or at a higher level."
F,Forecast value,"Value deemed to assess the magnitude which a quantity will assume at some future point of time (as distinct from ""estimated value"" which attempts to assess the magnitude of an already existent quantity)."
I,Imputed value,"Observation imputed by FAO to replace or fill gaps in national data series, in line with the recommendations of the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA)."
O,Missing value,"This code is to be used when no distinction is made between the reasons why data are missing. Data can be missing due to various reasons: data do not exist, are insignificant (or not collected because they are below a certain threshold), are unreliable, are not relevant for the period, or other reason not elsewhere specified."
M,"Missing value (data cannot exist, not applicable)",Used to denote empty cells resulting from the impossibility to collect a statistical value (e.g. a particular education level or type of institution may be not applicable to a given country's education system).
Q,Missing value; suppressed,Used when data are suppressed due to statistical confidentiality considerations.
N,Not significant (negligible),An observation is below the unit precision level.
P,Provisional value,"An observation is characterized as “provisional” when the source agency –while it bases its calculations on its standard production methodology –considers that the data, almost certainly, are expected to be revised."
R,Revised,Revised official figure.
S,Exceptional event,"Exceptional events such as earthquake, massive forest fire, draught and flooding that occurred in the corresponding period that may have affected the observation or caused a missing value."
T,Unofficial figure,"Observation reported by non-official or semi-official sources. Includes semi-official figure. Includes data from trade organizations (e.g. International Grain Council, International Sugar Organization etc.)."
X,Figure from international organizations,"Observations, both official and non-official, reported by governmental international organizations (e.g. UN, ILO, WB, UNESCO, Eurostat etc. specification on which international organization is provided in the metadata)."
